E. PERMISSIBLE CLOUD OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS
   1. For the purpose of these regulations, material workload means all systems, applications,
      and services that are fundamental for carrying out business of an RE, and if disrupted,
      have the potential to significantly impact an institutionâ€™s business operations, reputation
      or profitability.
   2. REs may outsource their workloads to CSPs in the following manner:
      a) All type of workloads (i.e. material and non-material) may be outsourced to reputable
          onshore (i.e. domestic) CSPs;
      b) EMIs, non-designated PSOs/ PSPs may outsource their material and non-material
          workloads to offshore (i.e. outside Pakistan) CSPs;
      c) Banks, MFBs, DBs, DFIs and designated PSOs/PSPs may outsource their non-material
          workloads to offshore CSPs. However, outsourcing of their material workloads to
          offshore CSPs shall be subject to SBP approval whereby SBP may grant approval on
          case to case basis, after considering the following:

    4. Ensure that the cryptographic keys are unique and generated only by the REs. Further,
        REs must have the sole ability to administer/manage these keys and HSM.
    5. Periodically change the cryptographic keys in accordance with the international
        standards and best practices.

                                                                                       Page 14 of 18

   6. Ensure that the encryption keys are stored separate from the virtual images and
      information assets.
   7. For material workloads, deploy/implement HSM with due controls.

R. TOKENIZATION
Depending on the sensitivity of data workload, REs may implement tokenization to minimize the
data footprint. While implementing tokenization, REs shall assess and evaluate the features and
data interactions of the tokenization solution. REs shall also ensure that the CSPs do not have
access or control over the tokenization solution.

S. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
The network structure and logical layout is of paramount importance in any cloud
implementation. Therefore, the REs must implement controls for protection against plausible
threats/attacks including cloud specific attacks, by implementing the following requirements:
   1. Ensure security of their CO arrangements and on premise environments by implementing
      controls at appropriate locations to detect and mitigate security breaches and ongoing
      attacks. These controls shall include but not limited to perimeter security, network
      IDS/IPS, WAF, DDoS protection, etc.
   2. Implement network segmentation based on type of workloads (e.g. production, pre-
      production, quality assurance, development, etc.) and purpose (e.g. end-users, critical
      servers, other servers, middleware, interface, etc.). In this regard, a dedicated network
      segment (i.e. management network) not accessible from other operational segments shall
      be implemented for administration purposes. Further, all internet traffic shall be routed
      through a dedicated network segment (i.e. security segment) and other network
      segments shall not have direct internet access.
   3. Secure traffic between the cloud and on premise environment using a VPN or direct
      network connection with stringent access control rules configured to ensure routing of
      traffic from/to dedicated source and destination IPs.
   4. Monitor and control access to and security of the cloud environments. In this regard,
      regularly review the firewall rules and access lists, especially after any changes.

T. SECURITY TESTING
The dynamic and evolving nature of cyber threats requires a high degree of validation and testing
of security posture of an enterprise, on periodic basis. However, security testing of the systems
and applications in the cloud environment is challenging due to the inherent shared service
model. In this regard, REs shall comply with the following requirements:
   1. Conduct vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and scenario based security testing
      of their systems hosted with the CSPs on periodic basis, at least once annually.
   2. Ensure that CSPs conduct vulnerability assessment and penetration testing for the
      infrastructure and applications managed by them, at least once annually in order to
      provide security assurance to the REs. Further, the REs shall be fully cognizant of the
      scope of such assessments while examining the results.
   3. Ensure that security testing is conducted while taking into consideration various
      scenarios and threats that are unique to cloud services including but not limited to
      hypervisor jumping, weak application programming interfaces, DoS hyper jacking,
      wrapping attacks, cloud malware injection, side channel attacks, etc.


                                                                                   Page 15 of 18
                                       Framework on Outsourcing to Cloud Service Providers


    4. Ensure that all vulnerabilities identified for their cloud related workloads are categorized
       in terms of risk, tracked and rectified (including post validated). For the infrastructure
       and applications managed by the CSPs, REs shall implement alternate mechanism for
       obtaining assurance that the vulnerabilities are timely rectified.
    5. In case of material CO, ensure independent Threat & Vulnerability Assessment of CSPâ€™s
       data centers hosting the data/systems of REs, at least once annually.

U. SECURITY EVENT MONITORING
REs shall establish mechanisms for SEM by complying with the following requirements:
    1. Wherever possible, leverage the controls/tools available in the cloud environment to
       enforce consistent security standards and baselines, automated response, remediation
       and notification.
    2. Integrate CSP related services with their SIEM solutions to provide a detailed analysis of
       the security logs. In this regard, cloud specific incident scenarios with correlation rules
       shall be implemented. Further, AI and ML driven technologies may be explored and
       preferably adopted, where available.
    3. Ensure that cloud related activities are effectively monitored by their SOC on 24x7 basis.

V. OTHER REQUIREMENTS
    1. REs shall monitor and review capacity utilization of their cloud workloads.
    2. REs shall provide adequate training of the cloud environment, to their end-users and
       privileged users.
    3. All security incidents / breaches shall be reported to SBP in compliance with the
       requirements specified in the â€˜Enterprise Technology Governance & Risk Management
       Framework for Financial Institutionsâ€™ or as advised by SBP from time to time. Further,
       REs shall conduct investigations to identify the root cause, take appropriate actions to
       prevent recurrence of such incidents in future and fix responsibility for such lapse.
    4. For material workloads, REs shall provide following information to SBP1 one month
       before placing their services with the CSPs:
       a) Name of the CSPs, and their parent company (if any);
       b) Description of the activities and details of data to be placed with the CSP;
       c) Date of commencement / renewal / expiry of services;
       d) Last contract renewal date (where applicable);
       e) Service and Deployment Models.
